# Crossbow Dynamics
## Intro
This project was to solve a question I had about crossbow efficiency. I was wondering how arrow mass affected the efficiency of a crossbow, so I set out to find the answer.

My hypothesis was that for a given crossbow there is an arrow mass that maximizes the energy transfer between the crossbow limb and the arrow.

*What I found for my crossbow*

With the crossbow I was using I maxed out the amount of weight that I could stuff into the arrows. While I was able to verify that arrow mass played a significant roll in energy transfer efficiency, unfortunately I wasn't able to find if the relationship ever tended down after a certain point, which was the other part of my hypothesis.

There were also complications in the video analysis, which I primarily attribute to the noisy background. 

Therefore when I return to this project I will use a more powerful crossbow with proper, large bolts, as well as using a noiseless backdrop, like a tarp or roll of paper, for the video.

Notice how the force-distance curve doesn't quite follow hooke's law. 
Crossbows are slightly different from ideal springs!
